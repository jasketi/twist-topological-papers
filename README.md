# Twist–Topological Research Papers

This repository serves as the **meta overview** and **first public release** for the three core papers outlining the twist–topological framework developed by **Jörg Ascher**. Together, these works form a structural synthesis of quantum gravity, cosmological phenomenology, and ontological foundations.
