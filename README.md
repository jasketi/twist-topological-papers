# Twistâ€“Topological Research Papers

This repository serves as a **meta overview** and **public timestamp** for the three core papers that outline the twist-topological framework developed by JÃ¶rg Ascher. Together, these works connect quantum gravity, cosmological phenomenology, and ontological foundations into a unified structural paradigm.
